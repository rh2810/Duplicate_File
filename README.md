Duplicate a given input file under the same or new name up to 100 times!

Directions:

- This program must be run on a Linux system or any system that can use GCC.

- Compile the program inside of the directory that you saved the duplicate.c program in:

  - Make sure that the file you want to make copies of (input file) is in the same directory as duplicate.c
  
  - In a terminal, type: "gcc -Wall -o duplicate duplicate.c"

- After compilation is complete, run the program:

  - From terminal, type: "./duplicate <input_file> <output_file> *number_of_copies*"
